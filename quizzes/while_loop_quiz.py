#PROBLEM 1:

#You work for a sandwich shop. Below is a list of sandwich orders that need to be completed
#and an empty list for sandwiches that have been completed.
#Write code that will ...
#   1.) Loop though the unfinished list and 
#       a.)print a message saying "We are making your <sandwich>."
#       b.) Add the current sandwich to the completed list
#       c.) Delete the current sandwich from the uncompleted list.
#   2.) When all sandwiches have been made, print a message saying that all sandwiches are complete.
#When your code is finished, unfinished_sandwiches should be empty and completed_sandwiches should be nonempty

#List of unfinished sandwiches and empty list of finished sandwiches:
unfinished_sandwiches = ['tuna salad', 'ham and cheese', 'meatball sub', 'roast beef']
finished_sandwiches = []
#YOUR CODE GOES BELOW:









#PROBLEM 2:

#You are working for a travel agency collecting data on popular vacation responses. 
#Below is an empty list called vacation_spots.
#Write code that will...
#   1.) Ask users to input a vacation destination they would like to visit
#   2.) Record their response in the list
#   3.) Ask the user if anyone else needs to take the survey
#   4.) Repeat 1-3 until the user says there are no more respondents.
#HINT: For this loop, you will want to use a flag or user-input (e.g., 'quit') as the exit condition.

#Empty vacation destination list:
vacation_spots = []
#YOUR CODE GOES BELOW:
