#In this assignment you will write two functions. Your functions should not make any print statements. 
#Any printing should be done by driver code outside the functions.

#Problem 1:
#Write a function tha will take two parameters: city and country. You can name it whatever you want.
#The function should return a formatted string in the form 'City, Country'. 
#For example, if city='sanTiago' and country='ChiLE', then the function should return the string 
# 'Santiago, Chile'. 
#Remember, any printing should be done from the driver code, not within the function.
#YOUR CODE GOES HERE:





#Problem 2:
#Write a function called double_sum which will take two parameters num1 and num2 and will return 
# twice the sum of the numbers. For example, double_sum(3,5) should return 16. 
#As in the first problem. The function not do any printing.
