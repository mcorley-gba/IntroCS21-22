#A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dicitonary.
#To avoid confusion, let's call the actual dictionary a Glossary instead.

#Below, you will make a glossary of 5 programming words that we have learned
#about so far in this semester.

#1. Think of five programming words that we have learned about and discussed
#   this semester. Use these words as keys in a python dictionary. Store their meanings
#   as the values (put the meanings in your own words, you do not need to look up precise or
#   technical meanings.)

#2. Print each word and it's meaning neatly formatted, one at a time. Some suggestions:
#   You could print the word then a colon, then the definition all on one line,
#   or you could print the word on one line, then the definition on a new line.
#   BONUS: Do these prints using a for loop through the dictionary.

#Your code goes below here:
