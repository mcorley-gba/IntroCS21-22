#should store two attributes: restaurant_name and cuisine_type. Make a method
#within the class called describe_restaurant() that prints these pieces of
#information. Make a second method called open_restaurant() that prints a message
#stating that the restaurant is open.
#YOUR CODE GOES BELOW:






#After making your class, create three different instances of the class.
#Call describe_restaurant() for each instance.
