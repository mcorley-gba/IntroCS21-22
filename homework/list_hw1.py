#Problem1: 
#   If you could invite anyone, living or deceasedk to a dinner party,
#   who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least 3 people
#   you'd like to invite to dinner. Then use the list to print a message
#   to each person, inviting them to dinner.
#Write your code below:





#Problem2: 
#   You just found out that one of your dinner guests can't make it. 
#   So you need to send out new invitations. You must think of another
#   person to invite.
#   First, start with your code from problem 1 (copy/paste below). Add 
#       a print() call at the end of stating the name of the guest who cannot
#       make it to dinner.
#   Second, modify the list of guests using appropriate python tools
#       to replace the guest who cannot make it with your new invitee.
#   Third, print a second list of invitation messages, one for each person
#       who is still on your list.
#Write your code below:





#Problem3:
#   You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available.
#   Think of three more guests to invite.
#   First, write a print statement informing everyone that you found a
#       bigger table.
#   Second, use the insert() method to add one new guest to the beginning
#       of your guest list.
#   Third, use the insert() method to add one new guest to the middle of
#       of your list.
#   Fourth, use the append() method to add one new guest to the end of 
#       our list.
#   Fifth, print a new set of invitations, one for each guest.
#Write your code below:
