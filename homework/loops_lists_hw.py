#Problem 1:
#   1.) Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a list.
#       Use a for loop to print the name of each pizza
#   2.) Make a new for loop that will print a sentence using the name of the pizza,
#       rather than just printing the name only. For each pizza, you should have one
#       line of output containing a simple statement.
#       Ex: 'I like pepperoni pizza.'
#   3.) Add a line outside of the for loop for part 2 which states how much you like pizza.
#       The output should now have one additional sentence.
#       Ex: 'Pizza is my favorite food.'

#Problem 2:
#   1.) Use a for loop to print the numbers from one to twenty.
#   2.) Use the range() function to make a list of odd numbers
#       from one to one-million. Use a for loop to print the numbers.
#       (Hint: To get only odd numbers, you will have to use the third
#       argument of the range() function.)
#   3.) Make an empty list called 'cubes'. Use a for loop to append
#       the first 10 cubes to this list in order. 
#       (Hint: You will have to use the ** operator to get the cubes.)
