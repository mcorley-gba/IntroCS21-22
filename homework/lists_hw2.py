#Organizing Lists:

#Problem1:
#   Think of at least five places in the world you would like to visit.
#   1. Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is NOT alphabetized
#   2. Print your list in the original order.
#   3. Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying
#       the actual list.
#   4. Show that your list is still in original order by printing it.
#   5. Use sorted to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without
#       permanently changing the list order.
#   6. Show that your list is still in original order by printing it again.
#   7. Use reverse() to change the order of your list. Print your list to show
#       that its order has changed.
#   8. Use reverse() to change the order of your list again. Print the list to 
#       show that it is back to the original order.
#   9. Use sort() to permanently change your list to be in alphabetical order. 
#       Print the list to show what has been changed.
#   10. Use sort() to change your list so that it is stored in reverse 
#       alphabetical order. Print the list to show that the order has been
#       changed.
