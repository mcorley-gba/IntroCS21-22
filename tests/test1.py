#This is Part 2 of test1. Below there are two programming problems
#   Program original code for each problem. You may use your notes, but
#   you may not use the internet or your neighbor.

#Problem 1:
#   Find a quotation from a famous person (you may use the internet
#   for this). Store the name of the person in a variable. Store the 
#   quotation in a separate variable. Print your quotation and person
#   by using the variables rather than the direct information. Use proper 
#   quotation marks for your quotation.
#   Example: John F. Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you, 
#               but what you can do for your country"
#Write your code below:








#Problem 2:
#   Use the built-in math capabilities of python and write 
#   six arithmetic problems that equal the number 8.
#   Each problem should use one of the five basic arithmetic 
#   operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division,
#   Integer Division, and Exponentiation. Print each 
#   arithmetic problem.
#Write your code below.
