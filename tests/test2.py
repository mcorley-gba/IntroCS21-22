#TEST 2: LISTS AND 'FOR' LOOPS

#All of the problems below are connected. 
#Work through each one and test your code to make sure it is producing
#the correct output.

#You will be writing a program that will build a grade-book for a test
#given by a teacher. You will be making two lists: a list of names,
#and a list of grades. Then, using 'for' loops and slices, you will
#calculate averages for the tests. 

#I will test your code on a set of ten student names in the form
#LAST_FIRST.

#First, create two empty lists: one for student names, and one
#for grades. 
#Your code goes here:
CODE_HERE



#Second, ask the user how many student grades need to be recorded. 
#Your code goes here:
CODE_HERE




#Third, create a 'for' loop that loops for the number of students
#given in part (2). For each iteration of the loop, you should
#ask for a student's name and append that name to your name list. 
#Your code goest here:
CODE_HERE



#Fourth, sort the name list in alphabetical order. 
#Your code goes here:
CODE_HERE



#Fifth, make a new loop that will use the names in the (now sorted)
#name list. Each iteration of this loop should ask the user for the
#particular student's grade. This grade should be appended to the
#grade list. 
#Your code goes here:
CODE_HERE




#Sixth, complete the code below to report to the user the number of
#entries in the name list and the number of entries in the grade
#list. Also tell the user the minimum and maximum grade.
#Complete the code below:
print('There are ', CODE_HERE, ' names \
    \n and ', CODE_HERE, ' grades.')

print('The maximum grade is ', CODE_HERE, ', \
    \n and the minimum grade is ', CODE_HERE, '.')



#Seventh, calculate the average grade, store it in a variable,
#and tell the user what the average is.
#Your code goes here:
CODE_HERE



#Eighth, using slices, calculate the average of the first three
#students in the list, store it in a variable, and tell the user. 
#Your code goes here:
CODE_HERE



#Ninth, calculate the average of the last three students in the list.
#Store this in a variable. Tell the user.
#Your code goes here:
CODE_HERE



#Tenth, calculate the average of the 4th, 5th, and 6th students,
#store it in a variable, and tell the user. 
#Your code goes here: 
CODE_HERE



#BONUS: Create a LIST of TUPLES. Each tuple should have the form
#(student_name, student_grade). Then, use a 'for' loop to print
#each tuple so that the teacher has a printout of each student
#and their grade side-by-side.
#Your code goes here:
