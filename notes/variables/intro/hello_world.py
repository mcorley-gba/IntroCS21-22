#Rules for Naming Variables
# 1. Variable naems can only contain: letters, numbers, and underscores 
# 2. Variables can start with letters or underscores, but NOT numbers.
#       Ex: _message_1 - Good!
#           message_1 - Good!
#           1st_message - BAD!
# 3. Spaces are NOT allowed. 
#       Ex: hello_message - Good!
#           hello message - BAD!
# 4. Avoid using built-in keywords and functions
#       Ex: print, input, eval, turtle
# 5. Variable names should be short, but descriptive
#       Ex: n   vs.     name
#       Ex: s_n vs.     student_name
#       Ex: length_of_this_student_name     vs. name_length
# 6. Be careful with l, 1, O, and 0
# 7. For now, avoid starting with uppercase letters.

# Two Common Naming Conventions:
# 1. underscores --> Ex: name_length
# 2. Camel       --> Ex: nameLengthOfStudent
# 3. Your own personal preference -- IMPORTANT: Be Consistent

#Typos

#What exactly are variables?
#Common idea --> variables are boxes in which we can store things
#                *slightly inaccurate (esp. later on)
#Better --> Variables are 'labels', or 'nicknames', for other (often
#           more complicated) things.
